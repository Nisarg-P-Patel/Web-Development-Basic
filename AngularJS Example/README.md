# AngularJS Demonstration

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic AngularJS functionalities including expressions, directives, and controllers. The project is designed to showcase how AngularJS can be used for data binding and dynamic content in an HTML page.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file that uses AngularJS to display and manipulate data. The HTML file includes the following sections:

1. **Using Expressions**: Shows how AngularJS expressions can be used to display dynamic content.
2. **Using Directives (ng-model-expression)**: Demonstrates the use of `ng-model` directive for two-way data binding.
3. **Using Directives (ng-model-bind)**: Illustrates the use of `ng-bind` directive for binding data to HTML elements.
4. **Using Controllers**: Shows how AngularJS controllers manage and interact with the data in the scope.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. No server setup is required as the project can be run directly from the HTML file.
